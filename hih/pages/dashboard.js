thought..
  maybe i can draw something like..
  a house in some grass...make it move a bit..
  fireflies that flicker,strobe, super slow with some keyframes? gotta really look into that..
  zoom in a moment for a transition.. 

another random allusion :  do you remember that red riding hood game? yeah, it was kinda pretty.. immersive..made me want to stay awhile..
